# üëë Leveling

### üëë MEE6

We're actually not entirely sure what you can do with the MEE6 Moderator feature since it's a Premium feature and doesn't show us what you can configure if you had Premium. They describe it as: "Boost your engagement by making your members compete and earn rewards by being active." and it costs ‚Ç¨12 per Month.

### üîç Alternative 1: Lurkr

Full disclosure before continuing: I (The website editor) co-own Lurkr. I will nonetheless express my opinions as unbiased as possible.

Lurkr strives to be the complete replacement for MEE6 leveling, offering more customizability, integrity and support than MEE6. [As featured in another life when it was still called Pepe Manager by No Text To Speech](https://youtu.be/uEHGNx3idFM), Lurkr offers importing your server's leveling leaderboard to pick up where you left off, in depth customization of the leveling progression using interactive multipliers which allow you to change the speed of leveling per role, channel or on the whole server! It includes a fully featuring web-dashboard and leveling leaderboard, virtually endless role-rewards to incentivize activity and much more automation beyond that.

Every server that runs Lurkr as their leveling bot has an almost unrecognizable leveling system thanks to it's customization. And on the off-chance you're not happy with it, they don't hold your data hostage!\
If you desire you can export your entire server leaderboard in one click in the dashboard!

üíµ Lurkr offers a Personal Premium plan for $1 a month to simply support the bot, and a Server Premium plan for $5 a month which massively increases a lot of the configuration limits.&#x20;

### üîç Alternative 2: [Cakey Bot](https://cakey.bot/)

Cakey Bot also strives to be a complete drop-in replacement to MEE6. While also supporting the same customization and features as MEE6 but for free. You can even directly import your leaderbaord data from Mee6 with a simple slash command. In addition to this, Cakey bot uses the same leveling algorithm as MEE6 meaning your users will continue to level up at the same speed as they expect.
As with MEE6, you can configure multiple role rewards for when your users level up as well as setting custom xP rates and even double XP days! Like most leveling bots you can configure both voice and text leveling for XP.

In addition to this, since Cakey Bot is an all-in-one bot, some of Cakey Bot's other features (specifically Achievements and Auto Responders) also have the capability to grant extra XP to users when they meet specific requirements to further increase user activity and participation within your server!

üíµ Cakey Bot provides a premium plan for $3.99 a month which allows you some additional customization such as a vanity url for your leaderboard.

### üîç Alternative 3: Polaris

Polaris is a great alternative to MEE6 aswell, and shares a lot of it's core features with Lurkr. It offers pretty much the same leveling customization, including a mathematical leveling curve adjustment for you to completely adjust the leveling curve and determine how difficult it should be to level up, the higher of a level your users already are.

Compared to Lurkr, Polaris does lack a few features in terms of customization, such as personalized rank cards, automatically level resets & all time leaderboard champion. Therefore it would be an ideal choice for Admins of small to medium sized servers.

üíµ Polaris is completely free.
