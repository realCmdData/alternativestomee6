# 👑 Leveling

### 👑 MEE6

MEE6 Leveling is made up of 2 types. Leveling message, and leveling roles. Leveling message tab is really not impressive, only thing you can edit is what mee6 sends, and the channel that its sent to.

As for level Roles and Channels, it just contains that.

They describe it as: "Boost your engagement by making your members compete and earn rewards by being active." and it costs €12 per Month.

as for the price of €12 per Month, it is a complete ripoff.

### 🔍 Alternative 1: Lurkr

Full disclosure before continuing: I (The website editor) co-own Lurkr. I will nonetheless express my opinions as unbiased as possible.

Lurkr strives to be the complete replacement for MEE6 leveling, offering more customizability, integrity, and support than MEE6. [As featured in another life when it was still called Pepe Manager by No Text To Speech](https://youtu.be/uEHGNx3idFM), Lurkr offers importing your server's leveling leaderboard to pick up where you left off, in-depth customization of the leveling progression using interactive multipliers which allow you to change the speed of leveling per role, channel or on the whole server! It includes a fully featuring web dashboard and leveling leaderboard, virtually endless role-rewards to incentivize activity, and much more automation beyond that.

Every server that runs Lurkr as their leveling bot has an almost unrecognizable leveling system thanks to its customization. And on the off-chance, you're not happy with it, they don't hold your data hostage!\
If you desire you can export your entire server leaderboard in one click in the dashboard!

💵 Lurkr offers a Personal Premium plan for $1 a month to simply support the bot, and a Server Premium plan for $5 a month which massively increases a lot of the configuration limits.

### 🔍 Alternative 2: Polaris

Polaris is a great alternative to MEE6 as well, and shares a lot of its core features with Lurkr. It offers pretty much the same leveling customization, including a mathematical leveling curve adjustment for you to completely adjust the leveling curve and determine how difficult it should be to level up, the higher of a level your users already are.

Compared to Lurkr, Polaris does lack a few features in terms of customization, such as personalized rank cards, automatic level resets & all-time leaderboard champion. Therefore it would be an ideal choice for Admins of small to medium-sized servers.

💵 Polaris is completely free.
