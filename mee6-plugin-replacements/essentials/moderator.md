# üëë Moderator

### üëë MEE6

We're actually not entirely sure what you can do with the MEE6 Moderator feature since it's a Premium feature and doesn't show us what you can configure if you had Premium. They describe it as: "Set up filters for bad or disruptive behaviors and words and let MEE6 do the rest." and it costs ‚Ç¨12 per Month.

### üîç Alternative 1: Discord itself...

Believe it or not, Discord's built-in moderation tools have come a long way in the last few years. You'll find them under the Moderation header of your server settings and they come with everything from Raid Protection, CAPTCHA, DM and Spam Protection, your very own customizable AutoMod and permission suggestions.

The main reason to choose the Discord first-party option is precisely because of that; it's first-party. This means that being Discord is the same entity that owns the platform, they can achieve much higher vertical integration than any bot can ever dream of. The AutoMod in particular is extremely versatile, and for example prevents excluded messages from being sent at all instead of being retroactively removed. If you haven't tried this, we highly recommend it, even if it's only a first line of defense.

üíµ It's free, unless it becomes a Discord Nitro restriction somehow...

### üîç Alternative 2: Sapphire

We featured this bot as an All-in-One Replacement for MEE6 and it's no surprise that on of it's main 'selling' features is excellent moderator tools and automation. It can hook into your already set up Discord AutoMod setup which makes it a great choice for a second line of defense, has seperate auto moderator configurations for different message types and channels, and even an experimental AI Moderation feature can be used!

As well as this, it has excellent tools to help your moderators keep track of who did what, keeps track of cases and logs and can even be used for user reports.

üíµ Sapphire has a unique monetization model where they offer Custom Branding in exchange for money. In my opinion this is an excellent way of incentivizing a more premium Bot but without compromising it's features.&#x20;

The only major drawback is that the price increases as the server size increases, I suspect to offset the potential loss of new users from the lack of branding on larger servers.

### üîç Alternative 3: Wick

Wick is a great automatic raid and moderation protector, though it has a lot more features that are premium only, and lacks the same overarching manual moderator tools that Sapphire as.

It features a lot of customization in terms of Auto Moderation by using a special Heat system. It also can hook into Discords own AutoMod system and has more sophisticated systems for Admin Nukes and Server Join spam. The only issue we have with these systems is that critical features are premium only, such as detecting member prunes as part of the Anti-Nuke feature, the entire Join Raid feature which is the most common type of Raid, and a special Panic Mode feature.&#x20;

Because of these drawbacks, and the slightly unconventional dashboard design we're ranking it lower than Sapphire.&#x20;

üíµ Wick Premium costs $5 per Month and Wick VIP costs $20 per Month for dedicated resources and custom branding, but at the time of writing it's sold out.

### üîç Alternative 4: [Cakey Bot](https://cakey.bot/)

Cakey bot is also another All-in-One Replacement for MEE6 and like Sapphire it's no surprise that on of it's main features is excellent moderator tools and automation.
In addition to Cakey Bot's powerful Audit Logging capabilities which we cover on the audit logging page, Cakey Bot contains a wide selection of auto moderation tools and commands that make managing your server a breeze. You can configure a huge selection of automatic rules include mass emjoji, mass mention spam, discord invite links, website blacklists and more.
One of the most commonly used feature's is Cakey Bot's constantly updated "Anti-Phishing" moderation rule which scans multiple online sources for known-malicious websites to detetc and block. In addition to this, Cakey Bot also live-scans any website that is not on any known lists for additional protection!

Cakey Bot also has several unique features as well like being able to lock specific channels to particular categories of content. such as making a "counting only" channel or a channel where users can only post their spotify playlisr URLs. This allows users to share their favoriate content without cluttering the channels with general conversations. 

There is also the "Auto Ban" feature that allows you to automatically ban user accounts when they join your server if they meet specific requirements. Some common attributes used during bot raids are new accounts that are elss than a day old, usernames that contain invite URLs or accounts missing avatar pictures. All of which can be configured.

Cakey Bot also has a very unique feature that large communities may find sueful as well: "Ban Sync". This allows server owners to group several of their servers into a single "pool" where Cakey Bot will synchronize any bans in one server to all of the other servers within the pool. allowing large server networks to maintain consistent bans across all of their servers.

üíµ All of Cakey Bot's moderation features are completely FREE.

### üîç Alternative 5: Zeppelin&#x20;

Zeppelin is an invite-only moderation bot that is vastly different to the other mentioned alternatives. In order to be invited your server must have +5,000 members or be verified/partnered.&#x20;

The reason we have it listed is simply because it is a damn good bot. The reason it is invite-only is because it has been designed for large servers in mind, and as such only has a .yml file as a configuration/dashboard, which makes it hard to learn but also gives extreme flexibility to tailor Zeppelin to any server it needs to server.&#x20;

If you're thinking of using Zeppelin for a smaller server, you can always self-host an instance of it yourself, the code is open-source which is also extremely important for those of us concerned about privacy.

üíµ Zeppelin used to have an optional Patreon but has since been discontinued.
