### Music - [Jockie Music](https://www.jockiemusic.com/)

Jockie Music is the one-stop shop for almost all of your music needs! Although it can be a little tough to get to know all of its commands and configuration steps, the sheer level of customization is almost unnecessary. Not only that but the website provides robust and easy-to-use documentation so with a bit of reading you'll be able to configure Jockie Music to act exactly how you want it to. Jockie Music was also initially created to be a system of bots joining together to act as one. One system of commands for 4 or more bots so you don't need to change prefixes for each new music bot you want to add to your multitude of channels!\

### Music #2 - [Green-bot](https://green-bot.app/)

Green-bot might be a little new to the block but it is a surprisingly easy-to-use music bot with slash commands and a super intuitive web dashboard to play music like you're on Spotify with your friends! However, what Green-bot wins for simplicity loses in design as the web dashboard, unfortunately, does not look exactly "finished". It also locks quite a few features behind a paid premium subscription such as autoplay, track announcements, 24/7 music, and more.\

### Music #3 - [Chip Bot](https://chipbot.gg/home)

Chip Bot is a long-standing totem of the free music bot pillar. It packs a ton of command features into a free all-in-one package, however unfortunately does not innovate where Green-bot and Jockie Music have, yet still delivers a complete package including audio filters, 24/7, autoplay, configuration, and more.\
