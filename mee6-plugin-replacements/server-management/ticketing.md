# 👑 Ticketing

### 👑 MEE6

We're actually not entirely sure what you can do with the MEE6 Ticketing feature since it's a Premium feature and doesn't show us what you can configure if you had Premium. They describe it as: "Streamline and organize the support process and allow users to submit support requests." and it costs €12 per Month.

### 🔍 Alternative 1: Ticket King

A Ticket Bot is supposed to help you stay organized when creating support requests or when a user wants to contact moderators privately in order to report a certain issue. Ticket King is a great solution to this and it's web dashboard lets you set up a 'Ticket Panel' which your users will interact with in order to generate a ticket with ease.

It lets you save transcripts, claim tickets so moderators don't get confused with who is handling which ticket, let's you set the category in which each ticket is created a lot more!

The only drawback is that the free version is only limited to letting you generate one panel, meaning if you want to have two ticketing systems for, for example, user reports and then user suggestions you'll need to pay for premium.

💵 The Premium Ticket King costs $5 per Month or $50 Lifetime

### 🔍 Alternative 2: Helper.gg&#x20;

Helper.gg is a solid Ticketing Bot aswell that has some unique features that Ticket King doesn't, such as letting admins view statistics of the tickets that are being generated, a web-overview of all past and currently in progress Tickets, and a whole load of interesting customization features.&#x20;

Unfortunately some really helpful automation features such as automatically closing a ticket after a certain time without a response has passed and closing a ticket when a user leaves the server are locked behind a premium model.&#x20;

What also is concerning is that Helper.gg is only one bot amongst a planned many different bots made by a company, Parent.gg. This means that it's not being run by avid developers but a company made to make a profit which could lead to the same sort of practices that MEE6 has adopted in the future, but for now we think it's a good enough bot to use.

💵 Helper.gg's Premium is $4 per Month for Ticket Automation and Translation, and for a total $6 per Month their Supreme upgrade gives you complete bot customization.

### 🔍 Alternative 3: [Cakey Bot](https://cakey.bot/)

Cakey Bot is a powerful all in one bot which means it has a ton of features including support tickets. However, this also comes with the draw back that the support ticket system will be a bit more limited compared to the dedicated ticketing bots listed above. 
Even with that minor draw back, Cakey Bot provides tons of customziation for their ticketing system. You can configure custom staff roles, the ability to ping the staff member and even allow users to provide feedback ratings on the support they were given.
Tickets also have a fancy full HTML web-based transcript of every support conversationt which includes images and such that were posted in the ticket. Cakey Bot also provides a selection of "premade" support ticket embeds that allow users to select from a variety of popular issues when opening a ticket, or you can have users provide a custom text reason when opening their ticket.

💵 Cakey Bot's ticketing system itself is FREE however you can upgrade to premium for $3.99 per Month and unlock the ability to automatically save transcripts for tickets. (Manual transcript saving is free)
