# 👑 Automations

### 👑 MEE6

We're actually not entirely sure what you can do with the MEE6 Automation feature since it's a Premium feature and it's not listed in their Support Base at all and doesn't show us what you can configure if you had Premium.. They describe it as: "Choose your triggers and conditions for different actions and put your actions on auto pilot." and it costs €12 per Month.

### 🔍 Alternative: Atlas Bot

Atlas Bot, as mentioned in our [All in One Replacement page on it](../../all-in-one-replacements/atlas.md) is a fairly similar MEE6 replacement, however it's main selling feature is in our opinion it's excellent **Actions** feature.

Using it, you can "Automate" a lot of different things in your server with staggering customization. You can choose from  a whole list of server events like when someone boosts, joins or leaves the server, adds reactions, sends messages and of course the classic keyword. It even lets you hook into their very own API, which opens the floodgates to create some extremely complex Actions over potentially multiple different platforms.

💵 Atlas Bot gives you a generous 25 Actions to start, and for €5 you can upgrade that to 100 Actions.
