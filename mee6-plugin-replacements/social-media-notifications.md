# Social Media Notifications
Mee6 recently removed notifications from it‚Äôs free service entirely, when all it ever was, was RSS feeds. 

### üîç Alternative 1: [MonitoRSS](https://monitorss.xyz/)

MonitoRSS is the free and customizable, web-dashboard included bot for all of your RSS feeds. Simply google how to get the RSS link to your favourite internet service, and the bot will send a notification to your server within 5 minutes of it being posted! New youtube videos, twitch streams, reddit posts, twitter posts, if it‚Äôs on the internet and popular enough, you‚Äôll be sure to find an RSS feed hidden in there somewhere! Don‚Äôt pay for features as old as the internet itself! \

### üîç Alternative 2: [Pingcord](https://pingcord.xyz/)

Pingcord takes a very similar, yet automatic approach to notifications as MonitoRSS does, and allows you to add TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Twitch, Reddit, Facebook & Twitter notifications to your server. Where it lacks though is in it's premium locked Spotify notification service and the 'coming soon' nature of custom RSS feeds, which is what MonitoRSS is perfect for. It it still however an easy to use notification tool for those who just want to be pinged and aren't too bothered about how it looks.\

### üîç Alternative 3: [Cakey Bot](https://cakey.bot/)

Cakey Bot also takes a similar approach as the above bots. By default Cakey Bot supports users providing YouTube, Twitch and Reddit URLs that Cakey Bot can send well-formatted embeds to a channel of the user's choice when new posts or uploads are created. If these social media platforms are not enough, users can also create raw RSS feeds for any website of their choosing as well!
In addition to this, users can also customize their social feeds by changing the color of the embeds or by selecting a role that will be pinged/mention when new posts are sent.
By default, servers can create one feed for each individual website type. Premium servers can create an unlimited number of feeds.
_Price: $0_ (Optionally $3.99/mo for unlimited feeds)
