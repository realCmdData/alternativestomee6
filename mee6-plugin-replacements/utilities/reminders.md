# Reminders

### MEE6

MEE6's Reminder plugin is a rare exception where every single feature in the Reminder Plugin is actually free. Now here's a shocker: It's also quite literally **the only feature that's completely free.**

### üîç Alternative 1: Dyno

Yet again Dyno proves that it is truly an All in One bot. Like the Polls plugin it is a basic feature, letting you set a time to be reminded and a message to write, however for 90% of people that's going to be enough in order to set a quick reminder to check up on a poll you set earlier, remind you to send out that important announcement or remind you to do your daily tasks in an economy bot of your flavour.

üíµ Dyno itself has a Premium option for $5 per Month but the Reminders feature is completely free!

### üîç Alternative 2: [Cakey Bot](https://cakey.bot/)

Cakey Bot which is also a powerful all in One bot also includes reminders. Users are able to use slash commands to create an unlimtied number of reminders using the bot. The remidners will be sent to the user's DMs when they have expired and there is no limit to how far in the future the remidners can be created.
_Price: $0_ (Optionally $3.99/mo for unlimited feeds)

### ‚ùå ANTI-Alternative: dotNotify

Here's something we don't usually do. During the research for this blog we stumbled across dotNotify which seemed a good alternative to recommend as a replacement for the, admittedly free, MEE6 Reminders plugins.

However as soon as we authorized with Discord it immediately sent us an Email with "\[IMPORTANT INFO INSIDE]" in the title. Not only that but it also automatically signed us up to their mailing list.

#### This is completely unacceptable!

A bot whose only objective is to remind you of something and schedule messages for you, **DOES NOT** need your Email address.&#x20;
