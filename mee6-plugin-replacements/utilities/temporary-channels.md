They describe it as: "Create temporary voice channels that are automatically deleted after a certain amount of time." and it costs €12 per Month.

### 🔍 Alternative 1: EmpyManager

EmpyManager, although it is an... intersting name for it's designed purpose is a very well thought out Temporary Voice Channel bot. It's setup with just one command and allows users to use commands and buttons in much the same fashion as TempVoice to control the temporary channel.

It's dashboard is rudementary in terms of features, things that are nice to have but is definitely not enough and not complex enough to warrant using a dashboard.

The Premium model is a lot more appealing though since it gives you 2 "Creator" channels right off the bat. The premium version also includes some features like self-roles that aren't the reason you invited the bot.

💵 Premium is €3.50 per Month and Premium+ is €7 per Month

### 🔍 Alternative 2: TempVoice

TempVoice is a very popular alternative to using and creating Temporary Voice Channels and for good reason. It's dead-simple to setup and works great: Join a designated "Creator" channel which triggers the bot to create a new voice channel for you, moves you into it and create a little panel with lots of buttons for you to control the voice channel.

This panel can be customized in the dashboard for you to change how much power a user has over their created temporary voice channel. They can do everything from changing the name and userlimit of the channel to giving control to a different user and block users from entering it.

The Premium model of TempVoice is quite reasonable aswell, unlocking more creator channels and fully customizable bot branding, and flexibility how many servers you want to buy premium for.

💵 €3 per Month for Premium without custom branding, €5 per Month with custom branding and up to €9 per Month for 2 additional premium servers.
