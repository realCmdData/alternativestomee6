They describe it as: "With our visual Embed editor, your announcements, rules, and other events will never go unnoticed again." and it costs €12 per Month.

As for the price of €12 per Month, it is a complete ripoff.

### 🔍 Alternative 1: Embed Generator

A simple name for a straight forward bot that does what you want it to do. Creating Embeds in Discord unfortunately are not allowed to user accounts only for bots, but they are extremely useful in conveying a lot of information for, for example, an FAQ channel or a Role Information channel, or even really beautiful announcements.

Embed Generator has a live updating website that let's you create a stylize your personal Embedded messages and then send it to a Webhook URL that you've already placed into a channel, or if you've invited the bot, send it directly into a channel.

Although you can save up to 25 messages to edit or send them later on as a template, you need to buy premium if you want to save up to 100 messages. The bot also has a custom commands feature that is premium only, but we urge you to check out our Custom Commands & the Automations section for alternatives to that.

💵 Embed Generator Premium is $5 per Month

### 🔍 Alternative 2: Atlas Bot

Atlas Bot is yet another bot we have already featured as an All in One bot, but as the name implies an All in One bot can do a lot of things. In particular we really like their implementation of what they call an 'Embed Builder'.

Fundamentally they have the same features as they both build on the same Discord feature, however Atlas doesn't support components, which are the buttons you can now click on underneath certain embed messages. Unless you really need components though, we think Atlas' Embed Builder is a solid choice, especially since it can be exported as simple JSON and also can be used throughout other Atlas features by referencing the embed you've made with the Embed Builder Link.

💵 Atlas Bot has a Premium for $5 per Month, but the Embed Builder is completely free!
