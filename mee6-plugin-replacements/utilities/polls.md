# 👑 Polls

### 👑 MEE6

MEE6 Polls plugin is used to create polls inside a server where your member can vote on.

They describe it as: "Polls are one of the easiest ways of engaging your community and allowing them to impact the action." and it costs €12 per Month.

as for the price of €12 per Month, it is a complete ripoff.

### 🔍 Alternative 1: Dyno

Dyno Bot is a top pick for our All in One bots list and of course, it has to have a polls feature. Polls are really simple and so is the Dyno Polls feature, but it definitely gets the job done.

Using the /poll command you can set a title, and up to 10 different options and the bot creates the embed message in the same channel as you wrote the command and adds the reactions automatically. All your users then need to do is tap on the reactions to vote!

It's beautifully simple and what 90% of people want from a poll feature which is why we're placing it to the top of the list.

💵 Dyno itself has a Premium option for $5 per Month but the Polls feature is completely free!

### 🔍 Alternative 2: EasyPoll

EasyPoll is a great alternative for Discord Admins who want more customization for their polls. The bot doesn't have a dashboard since it is still very simple but adds features like being able to accept up to 20 different poll answers to choose from, making anonymous polls, only allowing certain roles to join in the poll, how many choices each user can choose and so on.

It's definitely a great choice for people who either want these specific features on a poll bot or for people who don't have Dyno in their server already.

💵 EasyPoll is **completely free**!
