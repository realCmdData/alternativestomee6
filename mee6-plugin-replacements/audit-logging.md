Some events? What are some? Don’t worry, the Sapphire won’t skimp out on logs! You can let Sapphire log jsut about everything the API lets it log about your server! It can log when a channel is created/edited/deleted, a user is banned/unbanned, Emojis are created/edited/deleted, a user joins/leaves/is kicked, a bot is added to the server, a user is given/revoked a role, a role is created/edited/deleted, show role and channel permissions that are changed, server properties are updated (name, region, moderation, etc), a message is updated/deleted/bulk deleted, a user is given a nickname, a user joins/leaves a voice channel, a user is muted/deafened in a voice channel.
Sapphire is also extremely customizable!
