# Audit Logging

### Audit Logging - [Logger](https://logger.bot/)

Some events? What are some? Don’t you worry, logger won’t skimp out on logs! With a single command you can let logger log literally everything the API lets it log about your server! It can log when a channel is created/edited/deleted, a user is banned/unbanned, Emojis are created/edited/deleted, a user joins/leaves/is kicked, a bot is added to the server, a user is given/revoked a role, a role is created/edited/deleted, show role and channel permissions that are changed, server properties are updated (name, region, moderation, etc), a message is updated/deleted/bulk deleted, a user is given a nickname, a user joins/leaves a voice channel, a user is muted/deafened in a voice channel.
