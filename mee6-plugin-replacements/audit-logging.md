Some events? What are some? Don’t you worry, logger won’t skimp out on logs! With a single command you can let logger log literally everything the API lets it log about your server! It can log when a channel is created/edited/deleted, a user is banned/unbanned, Emojis are created/edited/deleted, a user joins/leaves/is kicked, a bot is added to the server, a user is given/revoked a role, a role is created/edited/deleted, show role and channel permissions that are changed, server properties are updated (name, region, moderation, etc), a message is updated/deleted/bulk deleted, a user is given a nickname, a user joins/leaves a voice channel, a user is muted/deafened in a voice channel. \

### 🔍 Alternative 2: [Cakey Bot](https://cakey.bot/)

Cakey Bot has a very detailed audit logging system. You can capture almost every event that happens in Discord and forward each event to their own custom channel. You can even customize different embed colors for each audit log event type as well. Alo unlike most bots Cakey Bot will even include images, attachments and other content linked with deleted messages and include a full transcript of messages when a bulk deletion/purge event occurs. Other audit log events also include extra metadata that most bots ignore as well. For example, user join events will display when the user's account was created which can help you target and remove fake/bot accounts.
