MEE6 allows you to make your own custom currency that your server members can grind on, and lose their minds.&#x20;

And of course, how do we find a plugin that doesn't have something limited and/or entirely locked up behind premium.

There are 3 items by default, if you want to add more items, you have to get premium.&#x20;
