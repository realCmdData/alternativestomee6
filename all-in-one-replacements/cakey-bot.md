# Cakey Bot

### üîç Overview

Cakey Bot is a unique and customizable bot that has been around Discord since 2016. It has a vast collection of features and it is designed to be a drop-in replacement to most of MEE6's features. While it is still missing some features the bot is actively maintained and the developers welcome feedback and suggestions from the user base.
Unlike most bots, Cakey Bot provides all of the base features for free and only locks some cosmetic customization and higher limits behind their premium offering.

Despite its minor drawbacks, Cakey Bot is an excellent all-around bot with a wide range of features, including automatic moderation, advanced leveling system, social media notifications, custom achievements, powerful auto responders, and much more.

### ü§î Who It's For

Cakey Bot is quite customizable and is designed to primarily be a drop-in replacement for MEE6. This means most users should find it fairly easy to migrate to. In addition to this, Cakey Bot has a very detailed wiki covering every feature and even has several in-depth tutorial video guides on their YouTube channel.
It should be quite easy for most average users to learn and should provide a good balance for both small and large servers.

### üíµ Price

Pretty much every feature in Cakey Bot is offered for FREE. The only things locked behind premium are higher limits on the features or extra cosmetic changes. For example, every server can make use of the Social Feeds and create one feed for each website type, however, premium users can create an unlimited number of feeds.

This allows most users to use every aspect of the bot without paying anything while still allowing the bot to gain some income from large servers that require larger limits than the average server.
