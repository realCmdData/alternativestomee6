# Gervase

### 🔍 Overview

Gervase is a unique and completely free bot that has been developed in only a year. The dashboard personally isn't as easily accessible as some other competitors but for that it is a lot more featureful. Unlike some simpler bots, Gervase focuses on making servers more customizable, which is done by showcasing bunch of plugins that server owners can use.

Despite its minor drawbacks, such as the dashboard incompletion, Gervase is an excellent all-around bot with a wide range of features, including manual and automatic moderation,  join roles, custom commands, and much more.

### 🤔 Who It's For

Gervase is a little complex to understand for new users and will require a time investment to make the most of it. As such we recommend it for more advanced Discord Admins or for those who want to learn how to use some of it's more advanced features.

### 💵 Price

Despite Gervase being a very good all-in-one discord bot with loads of features, Gervase doesn't have any premium and doesn't limit the use of any commands or features. Only limitation to some of its commands are the cooldowns, which makes Gervase a good alternative bot.
