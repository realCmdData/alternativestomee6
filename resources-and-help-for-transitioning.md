### MEE6 Leveling API Libraries

These libraries allow you to interface with MEE6's levelling API so you can extract your server's level data to transfer to another bot.

A pop-up will appear asking you if you want to cancel your subscription. Then you are all set as the subscription is set to cancel.

If you have confirmed to cancel, the display of your subscription will change to show how long your membership is still active until, the date you had set it to cancel, and if you would like to re-subscribe.
